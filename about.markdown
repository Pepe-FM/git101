Welcome to Git 101, where we take our first steps into the wonderful (and occasionally chaotic) world of version control! 🎩✨

This introduction talk will you how to commit, branch, merge, and (most importantly) undo your mistakes like they never happened. 🕵️‍♂️💨

If you've ever broken something and wished for an undo button, congrats—you’re about to learn Git! By the end of this, you’ll be pushing code like a pro (or at least confidently saying, “I think I know what I’m doing” 🤞).

Happy coding, and may your merge conflicts be rare! 🚀🐙
